This is a custom xbps-src repo that contains packages/changes to existing packages.

[WARNING]
====
This replaces the connman and libXft templates.

Connman now uses iwd by default and the bgra patch is applied onto libXft.

== How to install
1. Clone void-packages
[source,shell]
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages

2. Clone this repo
[source,shell]
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/notchtc/custom-void-packages

3. Merge them both
[source,shell]
cp -r custom-void-packages/* void-packages/srcpkgs

If you haven't used xbps-src before and don't know what to do next, here's what you have to do
[source,shell]
cd void-packages
\./xbps-src binary-bootstrap

To build a package you need to do this in the void-packages directory
[source,shell]
\./xbps-src pkg <pkgname>

Now you can either use `xbps-install --repository=/hostdir/binpkgs/ <pkgname>` or `xi <pkgname>` (if you have xtools installed) to install the package.
